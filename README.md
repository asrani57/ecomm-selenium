# ecomm-selenium
This is a test automation project which is an attempt to demo my skills at creating automation frameworks for business applications.

The framework uses the following technology stack - 
1. Selenium-Java
2. Selenium Grid
3. TestNG
4. Maven
5. Extent Reports
6. Log4J

Page Object Model widely known as POM is the design pattern used for this framework. Scalability and multiple platform support are given special attention while designing this framework.

The use of TestNG and Maven also makes this project very much CI/CD friendly to be used with tools like Jenkins

The project uses http://automationpractice.com website for coding purposes.

Apart from the automation project, this repo also contains a test case sheet that incorporates also the test cases for "Create New Account" use case. This file is located under /resources folder.

You might see some major and minor updates from time to time as my knowledge on the technology evolves.

For more information/support feel free to reach out to me.
